## Welcome!

### Bio  
![]({{"/images/IMG_1684.JPG"|absolute_url}})
I am a postdoc at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle where I am developing devices to evaluate the genetic mutations that contribute to acute myeloid leukemia.  I completed my PhD in analytical chemistry at the University of Washington in 2017.  During my PhD, I built microfluidic systems for quantification of DNA and mRNA to improve disease diagnosis and monitoring.  I moved to Fred Hutch in 2017 to explore new ways of implementing single-cell genetic measurements in research.
