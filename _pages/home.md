I am Alison Thompson, a research scientist living in Seattle.  I created this website to present some of my research and projects.

### Bio  

I am currently a postdoc at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle where I am developing devices to evaluate genetic mutations that contribute to acute myeloid leukemia.  I completed my PhD in analytical chemistry at the University of Washington in 2017.  During my PhD, I built microfluidic devices for quantification of DNA and mRNA to improve disease diagnosis and monitoring.  In the last few years of my PhD, I began to explore new ways of implementing single-cell genetic measurements in research.
